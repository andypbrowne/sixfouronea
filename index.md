I am a technology policy expert specializing in cybersecurity, privacy and digital identity policy. I am presently a Vice President in Global Technology at JPMorgan Chase, having previously worked in technology policy at the OECD, European Commission and Vodafone Group, among other organizations.

I am also an Oxford Martin Associate at the University of Oxford's <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity/" target="_blank">Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre</a>.

In 2016 I co-organized a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/african-studies-review/article/div-classtitleintroductiondiv/788C8F5BED1FE9AD46FC2D6613E23160" target="_blank">special forum on surveillance in Africa</a> for the African Studies Review.

I have a PhD in Information Systems and Innovation from the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx" target="_blank">London School of Economics and Political Science</a>, where I studied biometrics policy from 2006-2011.
