I am a technology policy expert specializing in cybersecurity, privacy and digital identity. In 2018 I joined the Tilburg Law School in the Netherlands as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Data Ethics.

My research interests include cyber policy, critical infrastructure protection, surveillance, biometrics, technology regulation, cybersecurity in the financial services sector, and data and development. I am particularly interested in exploring these topics across the Global South.

Prior to joining Tilburg Law School, I was a Vice President of Cyber Policy at JPMorgan Chase in New York from 2015-2018. I have also worked in tech policy roles at the OECD, European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Vodafone Group, and <a href="http://sixfouronea.net/professional-history/" target="_blank"> elsewhere</a>.

My recent publications include a chapter on cyber governance in the financial services sector. In 2016 I co-organized a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/african-studies-review/article/div-classtitleintroductiondiv/788C8F5BED1FE9AD46FC2D6613E23160" target="_blank">special forum on surveillance in Africa</a> for the African Studies Review.

I am an Oxford Martin Associate at the University of Oxford's <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity/" target="_blank">Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre</a>. I have a PhD in Information Systems and Innovation from the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx" target="_blank">London School of Economics and Political Science</a>, where I studied biometrics from 2006-2011.
