## Peer Review

_I have reviewed research articles for several academic journals, including Management Information Systems Quarterly, European Journal of Information Systems, Public Understanding of Science, Information Technology & People, Journal of Information Technology, Biosocieties, Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, IEEE Security & Privacy, Surveillance & Society, and British Journal of Political Science. However, I will now only agree to review articles for journals that are committed to open access._
